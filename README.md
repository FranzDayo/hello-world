# hello-world
This repo is for testing. It also can be a place for ideas, resources, and to share and discuss things with others.

Franz here, I like coding in C and C++ on embedded hardware and C# for PC applications. Recently I learnt Python because I want to work on a artificial intelligence project in combination with Tensorflow and Keras.
